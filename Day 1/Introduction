// What is TypeScript?

Imagine you're building a tower with blocks. If the blocks could talk and tell you where they fit best, building would be 
easier, right? TypeScript does something similar for coding. It’s like JavaScript, which is used to create websites, but 
it gives you hints to help you avoid mistakes. This makes your code stronger, like a well-built tower.

// How It Works

TypeScript works like a helpful friend who checks your work. When you write code, TypeScript looks over your shoulder and 
says, "Hey, this piece might not fit here," before you even finish. This way, you can fix it right away instead of finding
out later that something's wrong. When you're done, TypeScript turns your code into JavaScript with the help of (tsc compiler) 
so that any browser can understand it via Node.js

// Why Learn TypeScript?

Learning TypeScript is a great idea because:

1. It Helps Catch Mistakes Early: It’s like noticing a spelling mistake before you send a text message.
2. Makes Your Code Clearer: Everyone can understand your code better, even you in the future when you come back to it.
3. It's Popular with Companies: Many companies use TypeScript, so knowing it can help you get a job in coding.

// FAQs

// Q: Do I need to learn JavaScript before TypeScript?

A: Yes, but don't worry at all because in this #100_days_of_TypeScript Challenge we will cover both JavaScript and TypeScript topics simultaneously.

// Q: Can TypeScript be used for both front-end and back-end development?

A: Absolutely! useful in various scenarios.

// Q: Is TypeScript difficult to learn?

A: It has a learning curve, especially if you're new to types, well The more you (practice), the better you get.

// Conclusion

TypeScript is a great language that makes coding easier and less error-prone. By learning it, you’re not just following a trend,
you’re improving your skills in a way that will help you build better websites and apps. Join us in this 100-day challenge,
learn at your own pace, and see how TypeScript can change the way you code!
